# Winter-Dragon-Bot

## Description

This is a personal project to learn and improve at python.

Coding has helped me improve lots, and thus i have rewritten some functionality over time

causing a more robust, error-free and secure project!

## How to install:

This project uses a few modules that need to be downloaded, all of which are managed automatically inside the docker environment.

This project runs using docker. With 2 main containers, one for python 3.11 and the other container is running PostgreSQL as the bot's database.

Using `docker-compose build`, and `docker-compose up` should suffice to start and run the bot.

## Features:

PostgreSQL

Lots of slash commands with lots of features

customizability using a config file

dynamic seperate log files for the bot, discord, SQL (and potentially more).

Dynamic log saving, automatic removal of old logs to save disk space.

Lots of error handling

And more!
