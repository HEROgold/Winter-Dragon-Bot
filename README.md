This is a personal project to learn and improve at python.

Coding has helped me improve lots, and thus i have rewritten some functionality over time

causing a more robust, error-free and secure project!

## How to install:

This project uses lots of modules that need to be downloaded, these can be installed using

 `pip install -r .\requirements.txt`

This project runs using docker. With 2 main containers, one for python 3.11 and the other container is running PostgreSQL as the bot's database.

## Features:

Lots of slash commands with lots of features

customizability using a config file

dynamic seperate log files for the bot, discord, SQL (and potentially more).

Dynamic log saving, automatic removal of old logs to save disk space.

Lots of error handling
